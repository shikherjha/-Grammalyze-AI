        "- Transcribe the audio into text.\n",
        "- Score the grammatical accuracy of the sentence (1–5).\n",

        "   - By default, `MAX_RETRIES = 5`.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - If the caught error contains `\"429\"` or mentions `\"rate\"` in any form (case-insensitive), it's assumed to be a rate limit.\n",
        "   - The retry then waits using **exponential backoff** + some jitter:\n",

        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Immediate Exception Propagation**  \n",
        "   - If the error is **not a rate limit**, it's immediately raised, preserving original stack trace and debugging info.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Failure Handling**  \n",
        "   - After all retries fail, a `RuntimeError` is raised with the failed audio path.\n",

My favourite restaurant there is Melvyn's, it was a hangout, favourite hangout of the Rat Pack and especially Frank Sinatra. He had his wedding there and stayed, had his this honeymoon in Nextdoor as well. I actually really liked being there in the middle of summer. It was absolutely stunning.\n",

I love walking along the shore, feeling the cool water laugh at my feet and the gentle breeze tussle my hair. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore is soothing, creating a peaceful atmosphere as the sun dips below the horizon.

        "\n",
        "This block re-attempts evaluation for test audio files that previously failed during batch inference. It ensures we extract a valid `score` even for files that encountered transient issues like rate limits, network timeouts, or model errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 📦 Input:\n",
        "- `invalid_rows`: A subset of `df_results` where grammar score (`label`) is `None` or `NaN`, indicating failure.\n",
        "- `df_results`: The full results DataFrame to be updated upon successful retries.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ⚙️ Workflow:\n",
        "1. **Iterate Over Failed Rows**  \n",
        "   - Loop through each failed entry using `tqdm` for visual progress.\n",
        "   - Extract the audio filename and reconstruct the full path.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Retry Mechanism (Up to 3 Attempts)**  \n",
        "   - Tries to re-evaluate the audio using `evaluate_audio_file`.\n",
        "   - Implements **exponential backoff** with jitter to avoid triggering rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Success Handling**  \n",
        "   - If a retry succeeds, the score (`label`) is updated in `df_results` at the correct row index.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Failure Handling**  \n",
        "   - After all attempts, if evaluation still fails, it logs the filename for manual inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ✨ Features:\n",
        "- **Resilient Execution**: Recovers from transient failures without restarting the entire pipeline.\n",
        "- **Selective Update**: Only updates the `label` (score) to avoid overwriting other valid fields like transcription or suggestions.\n",
        "- **Exponential Backoff**: Helps mitigate API rate limit issues and stabilizes performance during retry loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 📌 Tip:\n",
        "- You can enhance this by also updating transcription/suggestions if missing.\n",
        "- After retrying, consider saving `df_results` again to ensure all scores are stored for submission.\n"
